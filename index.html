                        <h3>Full Stack Development</h3>
                        <p>
                            Since 2019, I have been designing and programming web applications with a strong focus on
                            backend development. My experience includes building Java-based APIs, developing RESTful
                            services, working with servlets, and integrating mySQL databases for data persistence and
                            management. In my current role, I have further expanded my backend skills, gaining hands-on
                            experience with tools like Gradle, Jenkins, and Node.js, and working across different
                            architecture styles.

                            On the frontend, I have built projects using React + Vite and Angular, with additional
                            exposure to Vue. To formalize and deepen my technical knowledge, I completed The Software
                            Guild’s certification program in Full Stack Web Development, where I created several
                            full-stack projects connecting user interfaces, server-side functionality, and databases.

                        <h3>More Languages </h3>
                        <p>
                            I am working to build my proficiency in other languages. I have quickly picked up Python,
                            and I am also working on more advanced projects in Typescript. I continuously work to build
                            a library of small demo projects (when I have time) to display a few of my capabilities
                            to employers. My hope is to gain exposure to other types of languages in order to build my
                            proficiency in problem-solving and code maintenance.

                    <div class="about-me__body">
                        <p>
                            I am a Full Stack Software Engineer with a strong foundation in curiosity, adaptability,
                            and a deep passion for programming and web development. Most recently, I’ve had the
                            opportunity to contribute to three distinct projects as a Full Stack Engineer, gaining
                            experience across diverse domains and refining my technical and collaborative skills.
                            My journey into software began with a background in environmental research and STEM program
                            coordination, which eventually led me to pursue a full-stack Java certification through
                            The Software Guild—where I discovered my true passion for software development.

                            My experience includes building and maintaining a healthcare data integration system using
                            HL7v2 and FHIR standards, as well as contributing to a standardized testing platform and a
                            content management system for federal grants. These projects reinforced my focus on writing
                            clean, maintainable code, implementing test automation, and maintaining thorough
                            documentation—all critical to delivering scalable solutions and enabling effective team
                            collaboration.

                            In addition to my Java-based full-stack development expertise, I’m actively expanding my
                            skill set with .NET/C# and Python, both in and outside of work. I enjoy designing and
                            developing applications independently, but I especially thrive in collaborative environments
                            that encourage diverse approaches to problem-solving. Prior to my transition into software,
                            I led initiatives at Delaware State University focused on STEM outreach, student retention,
                            and academic website management—experiences that honed my leadership, communication, and
                            cross-functional collaboration skills.

                            I am committed to continuous learning and growth, and I bring not only technical
                            proficiency but also a people-first mindset to every team I join. With a proven
                            ability to adapt, lead, and solve complex problems, I’m confident in my ability to
                            contribute meaningfully to any software engineering team.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I have obtained both a Bachelor’s and a Master’s degree in the environmental sciences and
                            energy and environmental policy. For four years, I served as the program and web coordinator
                            for the Center for Integrated Biological and Environmental Research at Delaware State
                            University. During this time, I discovered my passion for web development through my
                            interactions with the systems I relied on in my day-to-day work. My recent Java certification
                            allowed me to build on these skills and prove to myself that I am capable of excelling in this field.

                            Additionally, working as a coordinator for a four-year university over the past five years
                            has prepared me for a range of management tasks, including processing employment and payroll
                            paperwork, managing vendor relationships, meeting planning and development, and personnel
                            management. My experience in a college environment has also taught me to quickly adapt to
                            changes in policy, be responsive to the needs of faculty, staff, and students, and thrive
                            in both team-based and independent work environments.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I have many many many interests beyond coding including reading comics, manga, and books,
                            playing video games, watching lots of tv and just generally enjoying all sorts of fiction.
                            I also enjoy cooking and baking (when the time calls for it), and riding my electric scooter.
